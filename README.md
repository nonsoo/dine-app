# Dine App

Your challenge is to build out this 2-page restaurant website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The download includes mobile, tablet & desktop designs for a Homepage and Booking page. A design system is also included to provide colors, fonts, etc.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- See the correct content for the Family Gatherings, Special Events, and Social Events section when the user clicks each tab
- Receive an error message when the booking form is submitted if:
  - The Name or Email Address fields are empty should show "This field is required"
  - The Email Address is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
  - Any of the Pick a date or Pick a time fields are empty should show "This field is incomplete"

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
